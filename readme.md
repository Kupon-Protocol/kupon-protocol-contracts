# Kupon Protocol contracts

See instructions below to run the code on localhost and for blockchain deployment.

### .env

Create a `.env` file with the following keys:

```bash
ALCHEMY_API_KEY_MUMBAI=enter-key-here
ALCHEMY_API_KEY_ROPSTEN=enter-key-here
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=enter-key-here
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=enter-key-here
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=enter-key-here
```

### Compile

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Test

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Run on localhost

Start a localhost node:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Make sure to add one of the private keys presented as deployer key in `.env` file.

In a separate terminal tab then run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

If you also want to run frontend on localhost, make sure to download and run the 
[frontend Vue app](https://github.com/Kupon-Protocol/frontend) 
and also change the localhost contract address in `src/hooks/useKuponFactory.js`.

### Deploy to Mumbai testnet

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

### Verify contract on Etherscan/Polygonscan:

First make sure to have the correct key uncommented (Polygonscan for Mumbai or Etherscan for Ropsten):

```bash
etherscan: {
  apiKey: process.env.POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY
  //apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
},
```

Then run this command:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network mumbai <contract-address>
```
